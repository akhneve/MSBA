## PREPARE DATA
 
In our case we have to create new variables: log(Advertising), Advertising^2, and Lag(Sales)

```{r}

# Create log Advertising (we have done this for price so look it up!)

# Create Advertising^2
...2 <- (....)^2

# Create LAG Sales
... <- c(NA, head(..., -1))

# Display the data
summary(...)
```
