## REGRESSION MODELS

1) Define y (Dependent Variable). For this example, we have Y (e.g., sales).

2) Define X (Independent Variables). For this example, we have X1, X2 and X3 (some marketing measures, e.g., price, advertising)

3) Run the Models. For example, a linear model where Sales (Y) is a function of X1, X2 and X3

```{r}

# Run the Regression (includes an INTERCEPT)
lm.model1 <- lm(Y ~ X1 + X3 + X2, data = data.price)


# Display Results
summary(lm.model1)
```
