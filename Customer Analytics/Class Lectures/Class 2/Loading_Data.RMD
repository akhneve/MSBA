```

## First Steps 

NOTE: Your data needs to be in the folder where your code is located!

The "Loading Data" block will always do 3 Things for us

1) Clear ALL Variables (to make sure nothing is "left over") and clear the      screen. 
2) Read in the data we want to use. 
3) Explore the data (what variables are in it and what are some basic           statistics for these variables)

```{r}

# Clear All Variables & Clear the Screen
rm(list=ls())
cat("\014")

# Read in the Data
data.... = read.csv("....csv")

# Explore the data
str(data....)
summary(data....)
```
